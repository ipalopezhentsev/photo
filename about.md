I'm Ilya Palopezhentsev, living in Moscow, Russia. I'm a senior software developer at Deutsche Bank, creating software for automating FX market risk management. 
Photography has been my hobby since 2005. My particular focus is on the landscape film photography.

I've used a lot of cameras but my current equipment consists of:
## Film gear:
* Nikon F100 35mm camera & various lenses
* Bronica GS1 medium format camera & various lenses

## Digital gear:
* Nikon D750, sharing lenses with F100

I used to scan my film with Plustek OpticFilm 7600 or giving it out to labs. Recently, I've found a way to get great scanning quality at home using digital camera scanning & freely available RawTherapee software. This site will have articles on my work process.
